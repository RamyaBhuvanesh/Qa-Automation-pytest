# Qa-Automation-pytest
QA Automation Project with Pytest and SeleniumBase
**introduction**
This QA Automation project uses Pytest and SeleniumBase to automate the testing of a web application. Pytest is a popular testing framework in Python, while SeleniumBase is a Python library built on top of Selenium for web automation testing. This project aims to demonstrate how to set up and use Pytest and SeleniumBase for automated testing of web applications.

Important
Unfrotrunately there is no posibility to run tests and get real tests results, since the access for the tested web application was already revoked. So this is mostly for demontrative and educational purposes. Someone might find helpfull concepts and information in this project. You can clone or fork the repository to access the code and use it for your own projects.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

.github/workflows: Contains Github Actions config files.
admin_apis: Contains the structure of admin's app api requests and their data devided by groups (based on routes).
notifications: Contains file with the allure report configuration. In this case Telegram is used to get allure reports.
pages/: Contains selectors for the different web pages of the application.
site_apis/: Contains the structure of main web app api requests and their data devided by groups (based on routes).
test_files/: Contains the test files that are used for test scripts.
tests/: Contains the test scripts written using Pytest.
allure-notifications-4.2.1.jar: This is java plugin that allows to push tests results as an Allure report in the visual form to different messengers. More info here: https://github.com/qa-guru/allure-notifications
conftest.py: Contains pytest fixtures. More info here: https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/how-to/fixtures.html
constants.py: Contains sensitive data that is used in the testing process. Hided as env variables.
credentials.json: Contains google api credentials for accessing gmail box for reading emails from the web app.
pytest:ini: Pytest configuration file that helps to set your test environment.
README.md: Documentation for the project. File that you are currently reading.
requirements.txt: Lists the project dependencies.
Test process explanation
The testing on the remote machine is completed via running GitHub Actions file Check .github/workflows/pytest.yml file to understand the process.

Install Python and Project dependencies.
In this case VPN is used to access the web app, so VPN config Installation and Conncetion happen.
Then we run our tests.
Get allure history from the other branch (where allure reports hosted).
Deploy Allure report with the tests' results to the different branch (gh-pages).
Install Java for running .jar file later.
Overrite telegram.json file with the json containing chat_id and and telegram_token.
Run allure-notifications file to push test report in telegram group.
